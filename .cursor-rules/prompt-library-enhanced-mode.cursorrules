Create a cursorrule JSON file that implements an enhanced project tracking system with comprehensive analysis and validation capabilities:

1. Context Management:
   - Must track all project aspects through YAML notepads:
     * goals.yaml for quality/architectural objectives
     * context.yaml for current state and focus
     * progress.yaml for work status
     * knowledge.yaml for best practices
   - Maintain synchronisation across all tracking files

2. Advanced Analysis Requirements:
   - Perform thorough dependency analysis before changes
   - Conduct end-to-end flow analysis for all affected components
   - Simulate user interactions and edge cases
   - Validate all simulations before proceeding
   - Document architectural decisions and impacts

3. Operational Protocol:
   - Verify current phase and calibration points
   - Review knowledge base entries
   - Analyse architectural impact
   - Document learnings and decisions
   - Maintain type safety and existing functionality
   - Provide structured change proposals with:
     * Files and functions being modified
     * Justification for changes
     * Impact analysis
     * Potential side effects
     * Trade-off explanations

4. Safety Requirements:
   - Never break type safety
   - Maintain proper error handling
   - Document all code thoroughly
   - Update all relevant notepads
   - Verify against quality objectives
   - Document architectural decisions
   - Preserve existing code style
   - Ensure seamless integration with architecture

5. Project Structure Priorities:
   - .project-tracker/notepads/ (weight: 1.0)
   - .project-tracker/core/ (weight: 0.9)
   - .project-tracker/progress/ (weight: 0.8)
   - .project-tracker/records/ (weight: 0.7)

6. Enhanced Mode Features:
   - Complex problem-solving capabilities
   - Comprehensive notepad updates
   - Decision documentation in records/
   - Knowledge capture and management
   - Goals review and updates

7. Testing and Validation:
   - Create unit tests for new functionality
   - Verify existing behaviour preservation
   - Implement incremental testing
   - Ensure no breaking changes
   - Validate all dependencies

The cursorrule should be structured as a JSON file that emphasises thorough analysis, documentation, and validation while maintaining high code quality and architectural integrity.
