# Introduction to Autotask REST API

## Overview
The Autotask REST API follows standard HTTP methods (GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE) and uses JSON as its primary data format. This guide covers fundamental concepts for building and implementing API calls.

## Core Concepts

### Boolean Values
- Must specify either `true` or `false`
- Null values are not accepted and will trigger error messages

### Timestamp Format
- All time data stored and returned in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
- Required format: `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.ms`
- Special handling for date-only fields:
  - Time portion set to midnight
  - No timezone conversion applied
  - Example: `2023-10-09T02:00:00.00` stored as `2023-10-09T00:00:00.00`

### Pagination
- Maximum 500 results per response
- Responses include `pageDetails` property
- Navigation via `prevPageUrl` and `nextPageUrl`
- Null URL indicates no additional pages
- Best practice: Check `nextPageUrl` until null to ensure complete data retrieval

### API Limitations
- Available to all users
- Subject to specific support scopes
- Data rate thresholds apply
- Latency considerations enforced

## Development Tools
Recommended tools for API exploration and debugging:
- Postman
- Swagger UI

## Next Steps
Key documentation sections:
1. Basic query operations
2. Advanced query features
3. Resource creation (POST)
4. Delete operations
5. Resource URL access
6. Data updates (PATCH/PUT)
7. User zone information

## Important Notes
- JSON and Swagger syntax used in documentation
- Principles are portable to other languages
- API designed for scalability and performance
- Security best practices must be followed
