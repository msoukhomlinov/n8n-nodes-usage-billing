# Thread Limiting Implementation Guide

## Overview
Thread limiting is crucial for maintaining optimal performance when integrating with the Autotask API. This guide covers implementation details and best practices for managing concurrent description: autotask rest api,.

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Components
1. **Request Queue**
   - Implement a FIFO queue for API description: autotask rest api,
   - Track request timestamps and priorities
   - Handle request timeouts appropriately

2. **Thread Pool**
   - Maintain a fixed-size thread pool
   - Recommended size: 2-5 threads per integration
   - Scale based on workload requirements

### Queue Management
```typescript
interface RequestQueue {
    maxSize: number;
    timeoutMs: number;
    priorityLevels: number;
    retryAttempts: number;
}
```

## Best Practices

### Request Handling
1. **Priority Management**
   - Implement priority levels for different request types
   - Critical operations should have higher priority
   - Consider timeout implications for low-priority description: autotask rest api,

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement exponential backoff for failed description: autotask rest api,
   - Log detailed error information
   - Monitor queue health metrics

### Performance Optimisation
1. **Queue Monitoring**
   - Track queue length and wait times
   - Monitor thread utilisation
   - Set alerts for queue overflow

2. **Resource Management**
   - Release threads promptly after completion
   - Implement request timeout handling
   - Clean up stale description: autotask rest api,

## Implementation Example
```typescript
class ThreadLimiter {
    private queue: RequestQueue;
    private threadPool: ThreadPool;

    constructor(maxThreads: number) {
        this.queue = new RequestQueue({
            maxSize: 1000,
            timeoutMs: 300000, // 5 minutes
            priorityLevels: 3,
            retryAttempts: 3
        });
        this.threadPool = new ThreadPool(maxThreads);
    }

    async enqueueRequest(request: ApiRequest): Promise<void> {
        await this.queue.add(request);
        this.processQueue();
    }
}
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Monitor queue length
- Track request latency
- Measure thread utilisation
- Log error rates

### Alerting
- Set up alerts for:
  - Queue overflow
  - High latency
  - Error thresholds
  - Thread pool exhaustion
