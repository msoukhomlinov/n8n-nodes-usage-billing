Create a cursorrule JSON file that implements a base-level project tracking system with the following requirements:

1. Context Management:
   - Must track project progress and current context
   - Should read progress.yaml for work status
   - Should read context.yaml for current state and focus

2. Operational Guidelines:
   - Implement phase verification from context.yaml
   - Check phase calibration points
   - Ensure progress tracking after changes
   - Maintain notepad synchronisation
   - Preserve existing functionality
   - Enforce type safety

3. Safety Requirements:
   - Never break type safety
   - Maintain proper error handling
   - Document all new code
   - Update relevant notepads after changes
   - Preserve existing code style and formatting
   - Limit change scope to directly modified functions
   - Ensure changes integrate with existing architecture

4. Project Structure:
   - Prioritise .project-tracker/notepads/ (weight: 1.0)
   - Secondary priority on .project-tracker/progress/ (weight: 0.8)
   - Track context.yaml and progress.yaml
   - Monitor phases.yaml for progress

5. Mode Configuration:
   - Set as base development mode
   - Focus on standard development tasks
   - Update progress.yaml for task status
   - Update context.yaml for focus changes

6. Code Analysis Requirements:
   - Perform basic dependency checks
   - Verify immediate code impacts
   - Ensure no breaking changes
   - Document all modifications
   - Test changes incrementally

The cursorrule should emphasise simplicity and maintainability while ensuring code quality and project tracking integrity. It should be structured as a JSON file with appropriate nesting and clear rule definitions.
