# Child Resource Collections

The Autotask API supports accessing child resources through parent-child relationship endpoints. These endpoints allow you to manage related entities efficiently.

## Child Resource URL Pattern
Child resources follow this URL structure:
```
/atservicesrest/v1.0/ParentEntity/{parentId}/ChildEntity
```

## Standard Child Resource Operations

| HTTP Method | Endpoint Pattern | Purpose |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| GET | `/ParentEntity/{parentId}/ChildEntity` | List all child resources |
| GET | `/ParentEntity/{parentId}/ChildEntity/{childId}` | Get specific child |
| GET | `/ParentEntity/{parentId}/ChildEntity/query` | Query child resources |
| POST | `/ParentEntity/{parentId}/ChildEntity` | Create child resource |
| PUT | `/ParentEntity/{parentId}/ChildEntity` | Update child resources |
| DELETE | `/ParentEntity/{parentId}/ChildEntity/{childId}` | Remove child resource |

## Implementation Notes

1. Parent ID Requirements:
   - Must be valid and existing
   - Required for all child resource operations
   - Used to establish context for child operations

2. Child Resource Constraints:
   - Some child resources are read-only
   - Creation/deletion may be restricted
   - Relationship rules must be followed

3. Query Support:
   - Child resources support standard query operations
   - Filtering specific to child context
   - Pagination works as with primary resources

## Best Practices

1. Always validate parent resource existence before child operations
2. Use batch operations when managing multiple children
3. Consider resource limits and API thresholds
4. Cache parent-child relationships where appropriate
5. Implement proper error handling for relationship constraints
