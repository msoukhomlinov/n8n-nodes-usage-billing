# Autotask REST API Terminology Mapping

This guide provides essential mappings between Autotask REST API entity names and their corresponding User Interface (UI) terms to ensure accurate integration development.

## Core Entity Mappings

| REST API Term | UI Term | Context |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Company | Organization/Client | Default UI term is "Organization". In Client Portal appears as "Client". May also show as "Company", "Business Unit", or "Site" |
| BillingCode | Billing Code | Used for categorising labor and items for billing/reporting. Includes Work Types, Internal Time Codes, Material Codes, Service Codes |
| BillToAddress | Billing Address | Represents the company's billing location |
| ContractBlockHourFactor | Block Hour Multiplier | Determines block hours consumption rate for labor |
| Cost | Charge | Used for billable/non-billable monetary amounts. "Cost" only appears for Unit Cost or vendor charges |
| OrganizationalLevel1 | Division | May appear as "Branch", "Business Unit", "Sector", or "Segment" |
| OrganizationalLevel2 | Line of Business | Can show as "Application", "Function", "Product Line", "Service Line" |
| ConfigurationItem | Device | May appear as "Asset", "Configuration Item", or "Installed Product" |
| LeadSource | Lead Source | Used for lead tracking and referral sources |

## Location and Address Terms

| REST API Term | UI Term | Notes |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Location | Location/Branch/Site | Default is "Location" but may vary by organisation |
| State | State/Province/County | Varies by region and local terminology |
| PostalCode | Zip Code/Post Code | Regional variations include "City Code" or "Postal Code" |

## Important Implementation Notes

1. UI terminology can be customised through Admin > Features & Settings > Your Organization
2. Integration should handle multiple possible UI terms mapping to single API entities
3. All monetary values and charges use the "Cost" field in API but appear as "Charge" in UI
4. Regional variations should be considered for address and location fields

## Best Practices

- Always reference entities using API terms in integration code
- Include UI term mappings in error messages and logs for better troubleshooting
- Consider implementing a terminology mapping layer for user-facing components
- Document any custom terminology configurations specific to the implementation
