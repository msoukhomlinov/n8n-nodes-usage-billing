# Autotask REST API Security & Authentication

## Authentication Requirements

Authentication to the Autotask REST API requires specific credentials and headers. Failed authentication results in a 401 error.

### Required Headers

```plaintext
Username: "apiuser@example.com"
Secret: "abc123"
APIIntegrationcode: "ASHJKLFDKAHKASLFH85LSA905H"
ContentType: "application/json"
```

## Security Levels

### API User (API-only) Access
- Provides full system administrator access via REST API
- No access to Autotask UI
- No per-seat charge
- No limit on API-only user assignments
- Allows individualized credentials for integration partners

### Benefits
- No need to share full Autotask credentials
- Partner-specific credential management
- Enhanced tracking and diagnostics capabilities
- Integration activity monitoring

## Security Configuration

The API User security level can be modified to:
- Restrict access to specific modules
- Limit feature availability
- Control data access permissions

Note: Restricted licenses may result in no API response even when data exists.

## Encryption Requirements

- TLS 1.2 protocol required for:
  - Inbound connections to Autotask.net
  - All API calls
  - Partner integrations
  - Custom integrations

## SSO Considerations

- REST API does not support Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Uses pre-SSO Autotask credentials if SSO is enabled
- Passwords do not expire for API access
